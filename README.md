# Projects
This repo is the showcase of the projects that I have been working on. Always working on improving, check back often. 

# How To:

The best option to run each of the files would be to fork the whole repository and open the files with respected software to compile. Screenshots for each project will be included as well. 

# C Files:
The tools for developing in C that I used was Visual Studios. 

Note** the file I have included is just the code. 

If you would like to run it for yourself then you will need to start a new project in Visual Studios (or any tool that can compile C) and add the file to the solution. For my machine, I was never able to compile successfully on solution platform x86. I had to change it to x64 to get it to successfully compile once the file was added to a new solution.
