# Projects
Hello and welcome! This repository is my collection of projects I have been working on. I do like video games, so naturally I tend to lean towards game projects. Like this simple and fun [trivia game](https://github.com/aquaman48/Projects/blob/main/C%20Projects/Trivia_Game/Trivia-Game.md#trivia-game-). 


# How To:

The best option to run each of these files would be to fork the whole repository and open the files with respected software to compile. For Visual Studios, I will include screenshots of steps to take for creating a new solution and adding/removing the files for our solution files to run and compile. 

`Screenshots for each project will be included as well.`

# [C Files:](https://github.com/aquaman48/Projects/tree/main/C%20Projects)

Compiler used: **Visual Studios**

`Note: the files here that I have included is just the code and not a whole solution file.` 

If you would like to run it for yourself then you will need to start a new project in Visual Studios (or any tool that can compile C) and add the file to the solution. For my machine, I was never able to compile successfully on solution platform x86. I had to change it to x64 to get it to successfully compile once the file was added to a new solution. 

Check here [VS-Assitance.md]() for a guide on creating a new solution and working with the C files in this repository.
