# Simple Pin Validation

Compiler used: **Visual Studios**
<br />
OS: **Microsoft Windows 10**

## Requirements

A simple PIN validator program that takes users input of a 6 digit pin with some requirements
1. input of six digit pin by six separate numbers
2. verification of input by second input as one six digit number; numbers must match
3. PIN must not start with a zero

Will also inlcude a Menu: 

1. for entering a PIN twice
2. for checking if PINs are equal
3. for checking if PIN Number violates zero starter rule
4. for exit

<br />

## Expectation

Like all programs we want them to do what they say right? 
Well this was one of my first projects where I was sticking to the requirements other than my own. 
I did find that the requirements were helpful to help guide the process. For example, with the use of the menu.
That made it made it easier to stick with the requirements as each option was made to test the requirements. 


## Results

When the program is compiled in Visual Studios the results we get can be seen below. As you can see we met each requirement that was laid out for us. 

Now, for some this is the end point, we got it running and thats that. Time to go to the next one. However, that might be the case for me as well for now. There are a few ideas I can think of to make it a little better. Like in the trivia game with the the use of clear screen. We could keep the screen less cluttered and organized better. That is just one idea and there are plenty of more. Feel free to expand on this and do share your thoughts!
