# Microsoft Visual Studios Assistance

So, you want to run the file yourself? Ok, if you already have the latest version of Microsoft Visual Studios installed then we can move forward.
If you do not have it installed then please install it and all the dependencies for working with C++ files. You can click [**here**](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/) to download the free version of Microsoft Visual Studios. The community edition is free. When downloading keep an eye out for the C++ console files. 

## Getting Started

#### **Step 1**
<br />
Once you have everything installed and your workstation has been restarted you should be good to go. Once Visual Studios is open you will see a screen like the one below. On the right side of the screen we want to create a new project.
