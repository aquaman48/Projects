Compiler used: Visual Studios



## Intro/Main Menu 

For the Trivia game we use a simple menu that gives the user a brief introduction and then options to make a selection.

## Sports Question

After choosing an answer the program will let us know if we were correct or not.

In the do while loop on line 20 you can see system("CLS"); ![cls](https://github.com/aquaman48/Projects/blob/main/C%20Projects/Screenshots/Code-Snippets/cls.png)

#### This is clearing the screen with each selection. Instead of repeating in a line on our screen, we will see it only one time. 

Down at the end of the do while loop on line 51 you will see pause(2); ![pause](https://github.com/aquaman48/Projects/blob/main/C%20Projects/Screenshots/Code-Snippets/pause.png)

The (2) is what we are stating for the time. So, after input and pressing enter you will see "correct" or "incorrect" for 2 seconds. After these 2 seconds, 
you will go back to the main menu of the program.
